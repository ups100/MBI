These files should be put in the same (or sub) of executable file (/bin in Linuxdistribution). Files are separated into 2 parts - list of sequences and expected results in XX=Y format, where XX are symbols in sequence and Y is expected, integer result of BLOSUM matrix. These provided results are checked against results of provided BLOSUM implementation. 

If user wants to add custom list of sequence, should used the same syntax as described above add store them in file with .mbi extension.
